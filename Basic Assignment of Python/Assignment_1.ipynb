    "   2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "i)    spam    it is a variable\n",
    "ii)  'spam'   it is a string\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable - Variables are data values that can change when the user is asked a question, for example, their age. \n",
    "           Variables may change during program execution. A variable is a memory location. \n",
    "           It has a name that is associated with that location. The memory location is used to hold data.\n",
    "\n",
    "String - A string is a data type used in programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, \n",
    "         but is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters or sequence of characters \n",
    "         that can also contain spaces and numbers. \n",
    "         For example, the word \"hamburger\" and the phrase \"I ate 3 hamburgers\" are both strings.\n",
    "         \n",
    "   3. Describe three different data forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "i) integers - This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers \n",
    "              (without fraction or decimal). In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.\n",
    "              \n",
    "ii) string - A string is a data type used in programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, \n",
    "             but is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters or sequence of characters \n",

    "             For example, the word \"hamburger\" and the phrase \"I ate 3 hamburgers\" are both strings.\n",
    "         \n",
    "iii) boolean - Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False. \n",
    "               True and False with capital ‘T’ and ‘F’ are valid booleans.\n",
    "               Boolean objects that are equal to True are true, and those equal to False are false. \n",
    "               It is denoted by the class bool.        \n",
    "\n",
    "   4. What makes up an expression? What are the functions of all expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "      Python expressions only contain identifiers, literals, and operators.\n",
    "      Or in other words an expression is made up of variables, operators, and method invocations,\n",
    "      which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. In this chapter, assignment statements such as spam = 10 were added. \n",
    "      What's the difference between a declaration and an expression?\n",
    "      \n",
    "      Declaration:\n",
    "      Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n",
    "      Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.\n",
    "\n",
    "      Expression:\n",
    "      Expressions are representations of value. They are different from statement in the fact that statements do something \n",
    "      while expressions are representation of value. \n",
    "      For example any string is also an expressions since it represents the value of the string as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "      \n",
    "      bacon = 22\n",
    "      bacon + 1\n",
    "      the variable bacon contains 23\n",
    "\n",
    "   7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "\n",
    "       'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "       'spam' * 3\n",
    "        spamspamspam\n",
    "        \n",
    "   8. Why is it that eggs is a true variable name but 100 is not?\n",
    "\n",
    "      Rules for Python variables:\n",
    "      \n",
    "      A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character\n",
    "      A variable name cannot start with a number\n",
    "      A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n",
    "      Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)\n",
    "      \n",
    "   9. Which of the following three functions may be used to convert a value to an integer, a floating-point number, or a string?\n",
